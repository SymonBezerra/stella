Stella (tribute to "Stella Maris", an ancient Latin title for the Blessed Virgin Mary)
is a library for teaching Graph Theory on Computer Science courses,
and other programming related subjects. It is meant to be efficient on performance,
using C++ as its base, but also comes with a Python wrapper.
One of its core features is the individuality of nodes, edges, and graphs
as object-oriented implementations, favouring a comprehensible and extensible code.
